	<p>Hi there! My name is Eve, and I'm a data scientist in Denver with a thing for baking. Just a Byte is my first blog ever, in which I'll primarily be sharing my journey into baking, programming, and a little bit of everything else. The plot twist is, I'm not a very good baker...yet. This blog is more of a progress account than a how-to. It'll probably be more like a how-not-to, if anything. In other words, buckle up - it's about to get weird.</p>

	<p>Most of my life, I've been a boxed mix kinda gal, more interested in the end result than the process. I never really understood or appreciated baking from scratch until recently. I was looking for a hands-on hobby that I could do from home, and I found that baking was a good intersection of my interests. My other hobbies tend to be more physically intensive - mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking - and I wanted to get away from the computer screen a little bit.</p>
