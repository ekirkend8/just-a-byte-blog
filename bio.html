	<p>Hi there! My name is Eve, and I'm a data scientist in Denver with a thing for baking. Just a Byte is my first blog ever,
		in which I share my journey with baking, programming, and life. The plot twist is, I'm not a very good baker...yet. 
		This blog is more of a progress account than a how-to. (It's probably more like a <i>how-not-to</i>, if anything.)

		Before this, I was exclusively a boxed mix kinda gal, more interested in the end result than the process. I didn't appreciate the process of baking from scratch until I started this project. 
		I picked it up because I was looking for a hobby that was hands-on and away from screens, but less physically intensive than most of my other hobbies - mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking. 
		When I realized that I could incorporate my other passion, writing, I was sold. Even though, obviously, blogging involves computer screens, it's a fair trade-off, as creating my own website
		is something I've always wanted to do.

		So here we are, my first blog. I'm excited for what I'm bound to learn, and to share it with a larger community. I hope you have as much fun as I do.
