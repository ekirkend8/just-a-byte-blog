	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Buckle up - it's going to get weird.</p>

	<p>This is my first stab at blogging and baking, so throughout this process, I'm going to learn a lot about programming, baking, and myself. At its core, Just a Byte is an account of my progress in life, and by no means a how-to guide. More likely a guide on how-not-to. The journey will be fun for me, and I hope you have fun reading about it, too.</p>

	<p><strong>Why baking?</strong> I've been baking all my life, but mostly from box mixes, because I was more excited about the end result than the process. Since becoming an adult, computer screentime has become a huge part of my life, so I decided to invest in a hobby that involved less screentime and more of everything else. After some self-reflection, I figured baking would be fun and rewarding to try. I do enjoy physical activity a lot, like mountain biking, rock climbing, and sports, so baking was something that was more relaxing, chill, and something that will take me a while to get good at.</p> 
	<p><strong>If you're avoiding screens, then why are you blogging?</strong> Good question, and something I asked myself as well. It's because I also love thinking, writing, and programming, and blogging allows me to share my progress and thoughts. I've always wanted to create a website, so in the end, this became a really exciting and motivating project.</p>
	<p><strong>Why Just a Byte?</strong> My first name is really Evelyn, after my great-grandmother, but I go by Eve. I've always been fascinated by the "Eve" archetype, and I thought it would be cool to incorporate it into my blog. First and foremost, the phrase is a double entendre regarding Eve's bite into the apple crossed with my interest in programming. I tried to capture this in my logo, as well. In another light, my blog (and life) is an effort to taste as much of what life has to offer as possible, even though in total, it's going to be a small chunk of the world. But, how do you eat an apple? Just a byte at a time...</p>
